Moneo is an intelligent personal finance tracker and coach designed specifically for the Indian context. Unlike traditional expense trackers, Moneo uses **Agentic AI** (powered by Google Gemini) to actively monitor your budget, detect emotional spending triggers, and guide you toward wealth creation using the **50-30-20 rule**.

##  Key Features

###  Agentic AI Coach
- **Context-Aware:** Knows your real-time income, expenses, and savings.
- **Proactive Nudges:** Detects if you are overspending on "Lifestyle" or lagging in "Savings" and alerts you *before* it's too late.
- **Emotional Intelligence:** Detects stress spending, boredom shopping, or impulse buys and shifts its tone to be supportive yet practical.

###  Intelligent Budgeting (50-30-20)
- Automatically splits your income into **Essentials (50%)**, **Lifestyle (30%)**, and **Savings (20%)**.
- Visual progress bars that change color (Green/Yellow/Red) based on your health.
- **Smart Alerts:** "You exceeded Essentials by ₹2,000. This is eating into your savings."

###  The "Reflect" Timer
- A dedicated space to curb impulse buying.
- Add an item you want to buy and set a timer (e.g., 24 hours).
- When the timer ends, Moneo asks: *"Do you still want to buy this?"* reducing emotional spending.

###  Subscription Management
- Tracks recurring payments (Netflix, Spotify, Zomato, etc.).
- Calculates monthly impact of yearly plans.
- **Usage Check:** Periodically asks if you are actually using your active subscriptions.

### 🇮🇳 Built for India
- Native support for **Indian Rupee (₹)**.
- Contextual advice regarding UPI spending, FDs, and SIPs.
